    <h1> The Jolliest time of year! </h1>
    <h2> About my Holiday...</h2>
    <p> Christmas to my family means celebrating God, love, and the togetherness of our family. It's nothing but good vibes, music, and food. Everybody is in a great mood excited to give and receive from loved ones. </p>
    <h2> What Christmas means to me...</h2>
    <p> My favorite memories over the years of celebrating Christmas are the little things about Christmas. The good music and mood everyone is in just makes the Christmas season so much better. Decorating the tree with a big fire going, knowing you just have to get through a week or two more of school before getting to the jolliest most relaxing time of year is so soothing. It's not about materialistic things anymore now that I've grown up, the little things make it the best. </p>
